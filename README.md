Adding tags script into your $PATH, then that it! currently support python, I'll build more version for that.

## QnA

### Why using python3?
Becuase every morden computer have python3 preinstalled, so Python3 become the better options to build this tools. About the "Windows" side, I'm not consider to build it, becuase no much people are using termianl in windows (and terminal in windows is sucks, that's a common sens for sure :D )
